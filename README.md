# Avenue Code UI Challenge - Single #

### Story Phrase ###
* As a curious and sometimes forgetful web surfer, I want to add a simple history feature to this GeoLocation web application, so that I can see all the URLs searched by me on the current session.
* I sometimes use a desktop, sometimes a tablet and sometimes a cell phone, so I need a responsive web page.

### Business Narrative / Scenario ###
* GeoLocation is a working web application which aims to retrieve details about the user's location, as well to point out on a map the physical location of websites from their domain.
* You need to augment Geolocation by providing the history of all the domains typed in by the user, with the most critical info (URL, IP, Country, Latitude, Longitude and Date).
* You have to keep the current features working.

### Functional / Acceptance Criteria ###
* You can choose any approach for the history panel, such as a new page, an overlay, a sidebar...
* Each domain in this history should be a link, which when clicked will ultimately display its location again on the map along with its details.

### Non-Functional / Acceptance Criteria ###
* You can keep track of the information the way you think is best: JS framework, JS array, LocalStorage/SessionStorage, NoSQL database, backend...
* You have to cover all the new code with JS testing using Jasmine.
* Feel free to adopt any web app framework such as Backbone.js, AngularJS, Ember.js, Knockout.js, React.
* You must leverage reusability with the existing code. You might have to refactor some of it, specially when you are adopting a web framework. Make sure to keep the existing functionality up and also to fix any bugs you might run into.
* Don't break existing functionality.
* There may be problems with the "statdns" API used to retrieve the location. You can consider switching to a different one like http://freegeoip.net 

### Delivery Instructions ###
